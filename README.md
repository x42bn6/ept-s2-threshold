# ept-s2-threshold
A *draft* Python script that tries to find the threshold to qualify to Riyadh Masters 2024, as of pre-ESL One Birmingham.

Disclaimers:

*I am not a Python developer
*I have limited experience with optimisation

Most of the credit for this goes to "tkunt", who wrote [this article](https://tkunt.medium.com/computing-bounds-for-ranks-and-ti-qualification-of-the-dpc-2023-tour-3-870957df4ec5) for the Dota Pro Circuit.  I merely adopted it for the ESL Pro Tour.
